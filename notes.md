# Zilmorphs

**Zilmorphs** are a race of digital agents, embeded into the Zilliqa blockchain to fight digital battles within the web-space. They have potential to be very powerful, but cannot fall into the wrong hands, so were spread into 8000 *seeds* and stored as NFTs in the blockchain. Just like any species of creatures, there are different bloodlines of Zilmorphs, all with different genetic traits making them strong in different ways. You are the operator, your objective: accumilate zilmorphs to raise an army in the web-space, and challenge other players for *contracts* to win rewards and become the most powerful operator.

## contracts
Contracts are activities which operators partake in to win rewards. They have 4 ascending difficulties, with harder contracts reaping greater rewards. There are two contracts available for operators to take. The first is **shield contracts**. When a player receives a shield contract, they are tasked with defending an online arena against oncoming attackers for a given time period. For every shield contract, there is an associated *black hat* contract which, if taken, requires the player to attack the given server to receive the rewards. Operators who accept these contracts are the "attackers" that regular contract holders have to defend against. Because of this, shield contracts are inherintly easier than black hat contracts, since black hat contracts are only posted after a shield contract has been accepted, so it's possible that an operator takes a contract, but no other operators take the associated black hat contract, so the defending operator won't have to do any actual work.

The contract difficulties are:
- edge
- cloud
- cluster
- monolith

Edge arenas are the easiest to attack but the hardest to defend, and vice versa for monolith arenas. The reason for this is because for edge arenas, the attacker can invite other attackers to join, but the defender can invite no-one; for cloud arenas, the attacker can invite less and the defender can invite more and so on.

The rewards of the contract are public, so the first attacker/defender can see eveything that they can win. When inviting operators, they choose which/how much of the rewards to offer to joining operators, to incentivise them to help. Rewards are scaled by difficulty. For example, a successful black hat contract on an edge arena will reward less experience points than a sucessful shield contract on an edge arena, and vice versa for monolith arenas. Contracts share rewards, so if the defender(s) succeeds, they take the rewards and the attacker(s) gets nothing and vice versa. The losing operator(s) may still be awarded some experience points, depending on their performance.

## binding and boosting

It all starts with a seed. A seed can be considered a _Gen0_ Zilmorph. While they can be used, just like any other morph, they are very weak and won't do very well against well trained morphs. The most important thing they carry is their genetic traits. With these and a good knowledge of the game's binding system - a player can raise an army of zilmorphs. Two Zilmorphs can _bind_ to each other, to make a resultant morph: stronger than both of the orinials. This is only possible for morphs from different bloodlines. Over time, repeating this process will progress through the generations of the morph, and applying this to many different morphs will form a roster of power, available to the player.

A Bloodline of Zilmorphs share a set of dominant traits and a set of recessive traits. To train a zilmorph up to it's next generation, two generation matching zilmorphs from different bloodlines are bound together. For example binding a Gen1 and a Gen1 would make a Gen2 morph. The maximum generation is 20. The binding process is performed by a deep computation, that considers the compatibility of the morphs to attempt to create the strongest resultant morphs possible. However, this is an extremely diffucult task and can often produce undesired results - making sucesses even more precious. Zilmorph binding is an art, and any player able to master it will be able to train an unstoppable force, with the potential to become an uncontested champion of the web-space. During this process, the one morph is chosen as the _Dominant_, and another as the _Recessive_. This is done using the _genetic dominance_ attribute of the morph. Every seed zilmorph has a randomly generated genetic dominance from 48-52%. A morph with genetic dominance above 50% is considered to be "genetically dominant" and a morph with genetic dominance 50% or below is considered to be "genetically recessive".The bind computation will attempt balance the properties of each morph, such that the most genetically dominant morph will be chosen as the dominant in of the bind.

In the bind, the Dominant inherits the recessive traits of the Recessive, then the Recessive becomes _"orphaned"_. The recessive traits will be added randomly to either the set of dominant traits for the new morph or the set of recessive traits with the default chance being 70% in favour of the set of the recessive traits.

Binding morphs from different generations will transfer all the enegry from the younger morph into the older morph, causing the younger morph to die, but giving a small stat boost to the higher generation morph and maybe a temporary effect buff to the older morph - depending on what bloodline the lower generation morph was from. There are some bloodlines who's morphs are better for this purpose than for actual training, as they rewards they give to the older morph is greater than the outcome of training the morph. This process is called _"boosting"_.

## algorithms

Algorithms describe a set of steps on how to alter a morph's internal attributes to achieve certain effects on the morph. For example The player can use algorithms to strengthen or weaken the genetic dominance of a morph, or to increase the chance of a morph's recessive traits being added to the dominant of a new morph.

## orphanism

Orphaned morphs are morphs that belong to no bloodline, some of the seeds are born like this, but orphaned morphs are created by the process of binding, when the recessive morph is stripped of its traits. Orphaned morphs are not useful for training or boosting, since they have no bloodline traits so bear no rewards for either process. However, they are not completely useless, as a matter of fact, their lack of bloodline makes them a perfect fit for one specific use-case. Zilmorphs were designed with immortality in mind, since losing a powerful warrior could change the fate of the web-space war. To resurrect a dead warrior, pure Zilmorph energy must be combined with a resurrection algorithm, and given to the fallen morph. This pure energy can't be extracted from a morph with bloodline traits, since their energy is not pure, and has been effected by the variation of the bloodline. Orphaned morphs are perfect for this case, since they have no bloodline so emit pure energy. This energy can be captured and collected to complete a resurrection algorithm and bring back a dead morph. Extracting zilmorph energy is a passive process and does not effect the morph whose energy is being collected. The extraction rate of energy from a morph varies, depending on the generation of the morph

Zilmorphs >= Gen1 can be renamed. When a zilmorph is regenerated it gets a special badge to show its generation, or the card gets embezzled (a bit like rocket league profile picture outline or fifa cards). They also get a major stat boost and a new avatar. (We can use the fact that Gen0 morphs are seeds as an excuse for why they look so odd).

## mortality

Zilmorphs have no lifespan, from the moment they were first generated as seeds, if left to themselves, they would live on indefinitely in the blockchain. However, they are not completely immortal, certain activites can cause them to die. For example, boosting kills the younger Zilmorph in the process since the older Zilmorph extracts the energy of the younger so rapidly and agressivlely that the younger morph cannot handle it.

A player can invoke a _mortality algorithm_ on a Zilmorph too. This gives a lifespan to the morph rather than allowing it to naturally live forever. The length of the potion depends on the strength of the algorithm, with stronger algorithms allowing the morph to live for longer, but often being more expensive and harder to come by. While it may seem a terrible idea to put a morph through this, it is beneficial since it boosts the stats of the morph by a very great amount making the morph much more powerful than ever achievable with even the bets training methods.

A mortality algorithm can also be used to revive dead Zilmorph as an alternative to collecting pure energy. When the algorithm is applied to a dead morph, the morph is brought back to life, but with the curse of the lifespan attached to it. It also doesn't get any of the power buffs that the algorithm usually offers. To get these effects the algorithm would need to be applied twice: once to revive the dead morph, then again to empower the morph. Alternately, the dead morph could be resurrected with pure energy. If the mortality algorithm is applied to a morph that already has a lifespan, the lifespan is reduced.

## universe

The Zilmorph universe is contained within a time-loop, that repeats itself when the current _"genesis"_ ends. Currently we are in the first genesis, but the maintainers of the time-loop can trigger a reset, which will end the current genesis and start a new one. When this happens, the universe will completely reset. Players will keep their old Zilmorphs, but they can't be used in the new genesis, and will serve as a trophy of previous achievements.

## arcade

#### morphsino

Welcome to Morphsino the only casino that is configured to give on average the same amount of winnings as you put in! Every other casino is configured so that on average you lose! Morphsino is probably one of the most sophisticated blockchain slot machines out there. It leverages meta transactions, an oracle, and a cryptographically secure random number generator, in order to create a provably fair and well behaved slot machine that can be verified to be working as declared with the data that is accessible on the Zilliqa blockchain. The twist in Morphsino is that you pay Zilmorph tax on your winnings. Where the more **POWER** the Zilmorph you own has the less in fees you will be paying! That means that if your morph has 300 power the slot machine is configured to on average give you back as much as you have put in!

The base reward tax is 30%. For example: if you have a Zilmorph with power stat = 250, and you win 420 ZIL (the highest prize). You will pay 21 ZIL in Zilmorph TAX and the 399 ZIL is yours. The spin price is 10 ZIL. You can win either 20 ZIL 30 ZIL 70 ZIL 420 ZIL per spin. You can buy as many spins as you want with one blockchain TX. Spin, and then claim all of your so far unclaimed spins with one blockchain TX!

## events

Events are real-time competitions hosted in the universe, that put player's and their rosters against each other. Only the most powerful will prevail.

#### top trump games

#### attribute betting

## market

The market is a universe-wide area where players can trade items, algorithms and zilmorphs. Trading can take place as direct sales, buy/sell orders, auctions and raffles.

#### Zilmorphs

Zilmorphs can be bought at the market, either as new seeds or traded with other players. When buying seeds, players can pay extra to increase the chance of getting a morph from a specified bloodline, beware this is not a guarantee, just a nudge in the desired direction.

What are the actual mechanics of the contract battles?

The arcade is the non-zilmorph way to interact with the universe. You need a decent army of morphs to take contracts but you can play arcade games with no morphs. Contract rewards are much higher than arcaded rewards.

Rewards could be seeds, seed pair, morphs, morph pairs? And always XP.

-   In game currency
    -   Name for in-game currency
    -   You can buy in-game currency with ZIL
    -   Winning games can reward in game currency
	- Anything that can be bought with ZIL can be bought with more in-game currency so ZIL is like gems in COC

Arenas exist on web-space servers. After successfully completing a contract, players should have the ability to look around the filesystems of the servers hosting the arena they are attacking or defending. There will be storylines of powerful operators from previous genesises, their rosters they made and how they made them. These stories may contain some of these obscure or difficult binding techniques. The stories will be spread across multiple files that the players can find in filesystems. If we spread related stories to specific servers it may encourage players to target specific contracts, not even for the rewards, but for the stuff they might find.

Operators can read these files from the filesystem, or take the files so they other operators can't have them. This will be a manual process so that players can forget and accidentally leave valuable files if they aren't careful. When a player takes a page, an alert is sent out. "The lost files of X have been recovered from a server in Y". Players can sell the pages at the market. This may seem useless since if someone's takes a picture of a page and puts it on the internet then the page no longer has any sale value. To fix this we will give the holder of the page the ability to lock and unlock the technique it describes. This means that even if people learn the technique they won't be able to use it. When the owner wants to use it they unlock, then lock when they're done. The catch is that locking and unlocking is global and sends out an alert when it is done, so when you unlock, anyone who knows the technique can use it. Players can sell "unlock this technique for 5 min" on the market.

PvE shield contracts if noone takes the black hat?

Players have profiles/accounts
- They can change their name
- There are leaderboard for operator points
- operators have XP with a prestige system every 20 levels
- Each prestige level changes the players profile card to look cooler.
- Have an hours played counter
- Players have power ratings as X/Y where X is the combined power of each morph and Y is the players overall power rating. X should be the sum of the powers of the morphs before they have been influenced by buff and player perk boosts. This means that if you see a player with 500/4000, you don't know if the 3500 headroom is from player powers like direct magic abilities or from boosting the morph powers. This allows players to conceal their strengths abit more while allowing them to flex how powerful they are. Y is derived from the sum of X, plus all the other things that can make the player powerful, eg perks that boost stats of morphs, direct magic abilities, temporary buffs

To make the grind more interesting, the binding system should be very intricate, encouraging players to learn it better, making them more immersed in the game world. we want players to carefully curate a roster, due to the benefits the game will give them for being smart. for example, maybe there is a bloodline A that will reduce the overall score if they share a roster with some different bloodline B, so players have to choose a morph from one - but not both of those bloodlines for their roster since having both would damage the lineup. if we make the properties of those bloodlines polar opposites (for example A does double healing and B does double damage, but A and B are the only bloodlines with these abilities), then we push players into making hard choices about which skillsets they want their roster to cover. This will also encourage players to look for a way around constraints like these and try to "outsmart" the in game systems. this type of behaviour is good since it makes players more invested in the game, so to encourage it we should leave obscure workarounds available in the game, so if anyone works hard enough to find it, they'll be rewarded

introduce some wear or damage to the morph which increases the more it's used. this is 100% permanent and cannot be undone. It has little to no functional purpose, maybe morphs perform marginally better when barely used within the first 10% but at 100 it still works. Introduce some process in the game that can be used to permanently or temporarily decrease wear rate. This means morphs can now be rated on their condition (we can have mint condition morphs) and wear resistance.
